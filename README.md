# ðŸ§ª Vulnerability Management Lab Project

This is a  lab project I worked on to learn and practice vulnerability scanning and remediation using tools like Nessus and pfSense. The goal was to identify vulnerabilities in a virtual lab setup and document steps to fix them.



## Lab Setup

- **pfSense** firewall with 4 NICs:
  - LAN (for Kali Linux)
  - DMZ1 (Windows 10)
  - DMZ2 (Ubuntu Desktop)
- **Nessus Essentials** for vulnerability scanning
- **Kali Linux** used for launching scans and some testing
- Scans were done from Kali to Windows 10 and Ubuntu machines

| File                  | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Basic_Scan_Report.csv | Scan results from Nessus (Basic Scan) |
| vuln_register.xlsx    | Dashboard of all the vulnerabilities found |
| remediation_plan.md   | Steps I wrote for fixing top issues |
| screenshots           | Folder with images of scan results and Nessus GUI |
| README.md             | This file |

##  Summary

- Set up the virtual lab and network segments using pfSense
- Ran Nessus scans on internal machines
- Analyzed vulnerabilities and checked their CVSS scores
- Selected some important findings to document
- Wrote a remediation plan in Markdown
- Uploaded everything to GitHub

---

## Tools Used

- Kali Linux
- Nessus Essentials
- pfSense
- Nmap
- Excel
- Git & GitHub

---

## Skills Practiced

- Vulnerability scanning and interpretation
- CVSS scoring
- Writing remediation steps
- Using pfSense for network segmentation
- Markdown writing and documentation

---

##  Notes

This is a practice lab I did on my own system and not for any organization. Some configurations and vulnerabilities were purposely left open so I could learn from them.
